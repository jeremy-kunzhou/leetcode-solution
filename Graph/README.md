What I've learned after solving LeetCode graph problems so far:

Start by trying BFS or DFS for traversal, reachability, and basic graph exploration.

Then consider Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union), especially for cycle detection or connected components in undirected graphs.

If the graph is directed, think about Kahn’s algorithm (Topological Sort) for ordering tasks or detecting cycles.

For pathfinding problems:

Use Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths with positive weights.

Use Floyd-Warshall for all-pairs shortest paths (good for smaller graphs).

Use Bellman-Ford if negative weights or negative cycles are involved.
If none of these approaches work, consider DP with graphs, especially in DAGs using topological order.

NOTE : Be careful with integer overflow—graph problems often reach INT_MAX, so use LLONG_MAX when your logic seems right but the output is incorrect.
