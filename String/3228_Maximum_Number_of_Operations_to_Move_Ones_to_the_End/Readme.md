It was in Weekly Contest on July 21, 2024

# Approach

Tried to simulate the operations but failed to TLE

```
example: 1001101
which is the same as 101101
the question equals to move all the zero to the left to make no '1' before '0'
```

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(1)
